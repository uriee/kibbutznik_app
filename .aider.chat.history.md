#### advise commi  

I'm sorry, but your request is not clear. Could you please provide more details or clarify what you mean by "advise commi"? Are you asking for advice on committing changes, or is "commi" related to a specific file or function in your code?


#### commit changes  

To commit changes, you would typically use a version control system like Git. Here are the general steps:

1. First, navigate to your project directory in your terminal.

2. Check the status of your files by typing `git status`. This will show you which files have changes that have not been staged for commit.

3. Stage the files you want to commit. You can do this by typing `git add <file>` for each file you want to stage. If you want to stage all changes, you can type `git add .`.

4. Once your changes are staged, you can commit them. Type `git commit -m "Your commit message"`. Replace "Your commit message" with a brief description of the changes you made.

5. Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository by typing `git push`.

Remember, it's important to write clear, concise commit messages that explain what changes were made and why. This will help others (and your future self) understand the history of the project.

Please note that these instructions assume you're using Git and that you've already initialized a Git repository in your project directory. If you're using a different version control system, or if you haven't set up version control for your project, the steps might be different.

#### show diff  

I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to your files to show a diff. However, I can help you make changes to your code based on your instructions. Please provide the changes you want to make and the files you want to change.


#### show files  

I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to your files to show them. However, I can help you make changes to your code based on your instructions. Please provide the changes you want to make and the files you want to change.


#### can you find the .git directory?  

I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to your file system, so I can't locate your .git directory or any other files. I'm here to assist with code changes based on the information you provide. If you need help with something specific in your .git directory, feel free to ask!
